# GOBLIN GUARD ALPHA

A lightweight Chrome extension that **automatically mutes sponsored ads on YouTube videos**.

---

### ❓ What It Does

- Detects when YouTube is playing a **video ad**  
- **Mutes audio** and **blacks out the player** during that time  
- Restores sound and video automatically when normal content resumes  

This isn’t about skipping — it’s about letting the ad run while *you* step away or tune out.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

This extension watches for the subtle “Sponsored” badge YouTube uses to mark ad segments.  
When it appears, we **mute the video and cover it visually** — just like you'd do manually if you saw an ad start.

---

### 🎯 What It Was *Meant* To Do

Originally, this was built to **quiet sudden volume spikes** during mid-roll ads SO I COULD FUCKING SLEEP WITHOUT WAKING UP TO AN AUDIO JUMPSCARE.  
That’s it — not block, not skip, not hack.

---

### 🧨 Why It Doesn’t *Just* Mute Anymore

Turns out, YouTube doesn’t like when ads are muted — it will instead **refuses to serve the ad entirely** if audio can’t be auto-played.  

---

### 🛡️ Stability & Privacy

- We’ve built in **fail-safes and countermeasures** to keep it working even as YouTube evolves, but this is just prolonging the eventual catches installed for this.
- No analytics, no tracking, **no data collected or transmitted.**
- When YouTube changes again, we’re already a couple versions ahead. So if you have issues, reach out to me on Discord so we can get the latest version uploaded!
